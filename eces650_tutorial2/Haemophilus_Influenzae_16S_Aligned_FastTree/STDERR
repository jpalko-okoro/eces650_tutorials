ML Model: Jukes-Cantor, CAT approximation with 20 rate categories
Initial topology in 0.01 seconds
Refining topology: 10 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 9 rounds ML-NNIs
      0.10 seconds: SPR round   2 of   2, 1 of 40 nodes
Total branch-length 0.952 after 0.20 sec
      0.21 seconds: ML NNI round 1 of 9, 1 of 19 splits
ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -4629.132 NNIs 4 max delta 0.19 Time 0.24
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.669 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
ML-NNI round 2: LogLk = -4391.288 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.27
Turning off heuristics for final round of ML NNIs (converged)
ML-NNI round 3: LogLk = -4391.288 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.29 (final)
Optimize all lengths: LogLk = -4391.288 Time 0.30
Total time: 0.36 seconds Unique: 21/42 Bad splits: 0/18
